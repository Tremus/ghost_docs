# GHOST

## Presets

### Preset format

Ghost presets are saved in using the JSON file extension `.json`. This is a popular human readable text format that is relatively simple for computer programs to read and write. Compared to other binary formats, json files tend to be a bit larger, however they are much easier to debug.

### Preset location

By default, Ghost searches for presets in the following location:

#### Windows

`C:\Users\{username}\Documents\exacoustics\GHOST`

#### macOS

`/Users/{username}/Music/exacoustics/GHOST`

## Navbar

### Hamburger menu:

-   Init
-   Load Preset
-   Save preset
-   Check for updates

### Preset name

Opens the preset browser

Preset up/down buttons

### Level meter

Output in decibels for the left & right channel

Triangle controls the gain. This gain control can also be automated

### Oscilloscope

Shows audio output in mono. Intelligently detects the pitch of the acitve oscillator (A-B) in order to show what the waveform looks like.

## Preset Browser

### Spinning wheel

This is a loading wheel which is displayed while your preset directory is being scanned and metadata is being read. Each time you open the preset browser all your presets are rescanned in order to keep your data up to date. This is a heavily optimised routine and tends to run very quickly, even with a really large folder of presets.

**_Note_**: On Windows, this process may take a bit longer than on macOS, especially if you have lots of presets. The reason for this slow down is that virus protection software such as Windows Defender intercepts the file reading to scan the preset file for malicious viruses. Presumably, the preset will not be infected with viruses, and the preset is suspected to be temporarily _whitelisted_ by Windows Defender for 20 minutes or thereabouts. While on this whitelist, rescans of all these presets will be lightning fast, with speeds similar to macOS.

If you use Windows Defender and this slow behaviour proves to be too slow and frustrating to you, _it is possible to speed things up_ by adding the `.json` file extension to the Windows Defender whitelist, but for potential security and legal reasons I will not go on record recommending it to you. You can look up how to do these things yourself if you're curious and like to live dangerously.

### Search

This performs a case insensitive search of the filenames within the currently selected folder and its subfolders.

### Folders

Select a folder to filter presets belonging to the selected folder or one of its subfolders. Additionally, if the folder contains subfolders, you can click the triangle button to the left of the folder name to expand the list and view its subfolders.

To disable filterting by folders, select "All files" at the top of the list.

### Tags

Filter the presets by its tag within the currently selected folder and its subfolders. Filtered items will contain _at least every selected tag_.

You can quickly clear all selected tags by clicking the "Clear tags" button placed right above the tags.

### Preset table

The table columns **Name**, **Artist** and **Tags** correspond to metadata within your saved preset. You can right click on these fields to edit them.

The **heart** icon on the left can be used for favouriting presets. A list of your favourites is saved locally, meaning the list will be unique to your device and cannot be transfered to another device.

If you select the heart within the table header, you will filter by favourited presets.

## Oscillator

### Osc buttons

There are 6 oscillators in GHOST. You can change the currently displayed oscillator by clicking on the buttons labelled A - F. All knobs and settings you see in this area (show picture) belong to each oscillator.

A single left click will display the wavetable belonging to that oscillator. All of the pitch controls, filter controls, distortion controls also belong to each oscillator, so their changes will be reflected when you switch.

### Save

### Wavetable

Ghosts oscillator engine use wavetables. A wavetable is small digital audio sample that when played back fast enough, can sound very similar to analogue synthesisers. A great advantage of using digital wavetables is that a much wider variety of sounds can be produced, and they can be processed in ways that would be almost impossible using hardware circuitry!

Ghosts wavetables use shapes consisting of exactly 2048 points, with a maximum of 256 shapes.

New wavetables can be easily imported by dragging audio files from your file window or DAW and dropping them over this area. Supported audio codecs include FLAC, WAV and AIFF. Wavetables generated by other software and downloaded from the internet will most likely be compatible.

By right cliucking on the wave shape, you can open up a menu with some useful functions:
- Init: Resets the wavetable to the default consisting of a Sine, Triangle, Saw, Square and Pulse wave.
- Set preset as wavetable: Sets a new wavetable on the active oscillator. This is created by a launching a background task with a copy of your preset and recording the audio.


### Pitch

-   RAT - Ratio: This is a multiplier on the frequency of the oscillator. Eg. if you are playing the note A4 (440hz) and the ratio is set to 2, this will multiply the pitch to 880Hz.
-   SEM - Semitones
-   FIN - Fine - Control cents
-   TUN - Tune - Course semitone control

### Unison

-   VOC - Voices: Number of unison voices
-   DET - Detune: Controls the maximum offset in cents of the unison voices
-   SPR - Spread: Controls the bias of the panning towards the center or to the sides
-   WID - Width: Controls the maximum left/right panning

### Bottom controls

-   Phase: Offset applied the phase of the oscillator and all of its unison voices

-   Wave: Wavetable position. 
-   Bend -/+, Asym -/+, Sync, Window
-   Harmonic filters:
    - None
    - LP
    - HP
    - Stretch
    - Shift
    These algorithms manipulates the harmonics on the wavetable
-   Pan: Pans all unison voices by a given amount

-   Morph: With morph turned on, the oscillator will generate new wave shapes on the fly which are a blend between two wavetable
-   Retrig
-   Dir Out
